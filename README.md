Bare-Metal-Raspberry-Pi-Kernel
==============================

A bare metal kernel for the Raspberry Pi, written in C.

Complie main.c with the make.sh file; you will need an appropriate cross compiler (https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded).

Copy the resulting kernel.img, and the contents of the disk folder (minus the liscense file), onto a blank SD-Card.
Pop the card into the RPI, and go.
